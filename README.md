# calwyrd.sh

A replacement for Wyrd, an ncurses frontend for the excellent [remind by Dianne Skoll](https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/).

I can't get wyrd to compile in openbsd, probably because I don't know enough ocaml and it's basically obsolete anyway, so I wrote this little script to do the job not quite as well.
